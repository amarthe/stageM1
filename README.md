# Stage M1 - Alexandre Marthe

### Code Execution

The notebook is made to be able to try all the different possibilities of the algorithm and then vizualize the results.  
It is also possible to execute `initialization.py` by itself, by providing the path of the data file and the number of phases.
Two dataset can be downloaded at the adress: https://filesender.ens-lyon.fr/?vid=5e26fea2-a3d1-6ea8-e331-00007dbe815b  (it was too heavy for github).
The first one, `data.npy` is the default one. The other one is to try with `initialization.py` with 4 phases.

### My contribution in the code

I implemented the different initialization methods (except the "random" one) in `gaussian_dictionnary_learning.py` along with the code related to the Ridge and Spars regularization.  
I also created `the initialization.py` file.  
The notebook is made from the code I used to experiment with the algorithm.
